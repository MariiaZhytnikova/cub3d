## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of cub3d is to create a simple 3D game engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D. Using raycasting and the MLX42 graphics library, the project renders a 3D view from a 2D map, allowing the player to navigate a maze-like world. This project strengthens understanding of:

Raycasting techniques for 3D rendering

Graphics rendering with MLX42

Event handling and player input

Map parsing and validation

Game logic and collision handling

## 📁 Project Structure
### ✅ Mandatory Part

Parse and validate a .cub map file.

Render a 3D view using raycasting from a 2D map.

Implement player movement and rotation.

Handle wall collisions and prevent invalid moves.

Support textures for walls and colors for floor/ceiling.

Close the game when the player presses ESC or clicks the close button.

### 🗺️ Map Specifications
The map is defined in a .cub file and must include:

1 for walls

0 for empty space

N, S, E, or W for player starting position (direction included)

Texture paths for walls (north, south, east, west)

RGB values for floor and ceiling colors

🔧 Compilation & Usage
The project includes a Makefile for building the game.

make
./cub3d maps/example.cub


### 🎮 Controls

W / A / S / D: Move forward / left / backward / right

← / →: Rotate camera left / right

ESC: Exit the game

### 🧠 What We Learned

Implementing a raycasting algorithm to simulate 3D graphics

Using MLX42 for real-time rendering

Managing player input and smooth movement/rotation

Parsing and validating complex configuration files

Handling textures, colors, and collision detection
