## The RayCaster with miniLibX

### Key Concepts:

Raycasting:

- It's a 2D-to-3D rendering technique, where rays are cast from a viewpoint (often the camera or the player's position in a game).

- The idea is to simulate how light rays would travel through a scene and find the first object (like walls) they hit.

- This technique is commonly used in early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D.

miniLibX:

- miniLibX is a small library used in C programming to handle graphics, windows, and basic graphical operations. It was originally created for projects related to 42 (a coding school), where students often use it for graphical projects.

- It allows developers to draw pixels, handle user input (like keyboard and mouse events), and create windows to display graphics.
